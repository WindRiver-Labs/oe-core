Subject: [PATCH] Allow multiple attempts to connect to relayd

It is unclear why a session needs to be made
unusable after a failure to connect to relayd
since a check for a relayd connection is
always made before a session can be configured.

The behaviour was introduced in:
d9078d0c000d04d49c599a72c1a725026b636ec0
